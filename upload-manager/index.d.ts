 * PutObject request, or break up the upload into multiple parts and utilize multi-part uploads.
 * <p>
 * An advantage of using multi-part uploads is the ability to be able to upload parts in parallel to reduce upload time.
 * <p>
 * Callers still have full control over how the UploadManager decides to perform the upload using UploadOptions.
 * NodeJS V8 Engine have a buffer size limitation, 2GB for 64-bit machine and 1GB for 32-bit machine.
 * Do not make the partSize greater than the buffer size limitation.
